GSMer 
=====
GSMer devotes to identify genome-specific markers (GSMs) from currently sequenced microbial genomes using a k-mer based approach. The GSMs could be used to identify microbial strains/species in metagenomes, especially in human microbiome where many reference genomes were sequenced. Two different levels of GSMs, including strain-specific and species-specifc GSMs are currently supported.
